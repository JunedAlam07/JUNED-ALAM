This project is a basic project by using html css and javascript 
Here are some points i want to mention where you can get confuse
<input type="text" id="b1" onclick="myfunc_3(); myfunc();" readonly>
This is an HTML code snippet that defines an input field of type "text" with an ID of "b1" and two event handlers that are triggered when the user clicks on the input field.

The first event handler is "myfunc_3()". This is a custom JavaScript function that will be executed when the input field is clicked. However, since the input field is set to "readonly", the user will not be able to modify its content. 

The second event handler is "myfunc()". This is another custom JavaScript function that will be executed when the input field is clicked. 

 document.getElementById("b4").disabled = true;
 
 This is a JavaScript code snippet that disables the element with the ID "b4". The method "document.getElementById()" retrieves a reference to the element in the HTML document that has the specified ID. The property "disabled" is then set to "true" to disable the element.

The effect of this code snippet depends on the type of element with ID "b4". If it is a form element such as a button or input field, it will become unclickable and the user will not be able to interact with it. If it is a non-form element such as a paragraph or a div, the "disabled" property will have no effect.

Note that to re-enable the element, you can set the "disabled" property to "false" instead of "true".

else if ((b1 == 'X' || b1 == '0') && (b2 == 'X' ||
            b2 == '0') && (b3 == 'X' || b3 == '0') &&
        (b4 == 'X' || b4 == '0') && (b5 == 'X' ||
            b5 == '0') && (b6 == 'X' || b6 == '0') &&
        (b7 == 'X' || b7 == '0') && (b8 == 'X' ||
            b8 == '0') && (b9 == 'X' || b9 == '0')) {
        document.getElementById('print')
            .innerHTML = "Match Tie";
        window.alert('Match Tie');



This is a block of code that represents the condition for a tie in a tic-tac-toe game. The condition checks if all of the cells in the game board have been filled with either 'X' or '0' values.

If the condition is true, the inner HTML of an element with the ID 'print' is set to "Match Tie". This could be a message displayed to the user indicating that the game has ended in a tie.

Additionally, a window alert is triggered with the message "Match Tie", which will display a popup message on the user's screen indicating that the game has ended in a tie.

if (flag == 1) {
            document.getElementById('print')
                .innerHTML = "Player X Turn";
        } else {
            document.getElementById('print')
                .innerHTML = "Player 0 Turn";
        }
    }
    
This is a block of code that represents the turn-based gameplay logic of a tic-tac-toe game.

The code checks the value of a variable called "flag". If "flag" is equal to 1, it means that it is currently player X's turn, and the inner HTML of an element with the ID 'print' is set to "Player X Turn", indicating to the user that it is their turn to play.

If "flag" is not equal to 1 (i.e., it is some other value, such as 0), it means that it is currently player 0's turn, and the inner HTML of the 'print' element is set to "Player 0 Turn", indicating to the user that it is their turn to play.

This block of code is likely executed every time a player makes a move in the game. It ensures that the correct player's turn is displayed to the user, and helps to maintain the game's turn-based gameplay mechanics.

location.reload();
    document.getElementById('b1').value = '';
    document.getElementById("b2").value = '';
    document.getElementById("b3").value = '';
    document.getElementById("b4").value = '';
    document.getElementById("b5").value = '';
    document.getElementById("b6").value = '';
    document.getElementById("b7").value = '';
    document.getElementById("b8").value = '';
    document.getElementById("b9").value = '';
    
    This is a block of JavaScript code that likely appears in a function that is called when the game ends or when the user chooses to reset the game. The code performs the following actions:

The "location.reload()" method reloads the current webpage, effectively resetting the game board and any other elements on the page.

The values of each of the tic-tac-toe game cells (identified by their respective IDs) are set to an empty string. This effectively clears the game board, ready for a new game.

Together, these actions provide a way to reset the game board to its initial state, either after a game has ended or when the user chooses to start a new game.
